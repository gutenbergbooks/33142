<h2>STORIES</h2>
<h3>ABOUT</h3>
<h1>INDIANS.</h1>


<hr />
<p>The Indians were
formerly lords of
the soil we now
occupy, and obtained
a subsistence
principally
by hunting and
fishing.</p>

<p>They generally
lived in villages,
containing from
fifty to five hundred families. Their
houses, called <i>wigwams</i>, were usually
constructed of poles, one end
being driven into the ground, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the other bent over so as to meet
another fastened in like manner;
both being joined together at the
top, and covered with the bark of
trees. Small holes were left open
for windows, which were closed in
bad weather with a piece of bark.
They made their fire in the centre
of the wigwam, leaving a small hole
for a chimney in the top of the roof.</p>

    <p class="caption2">Indian Village.</p>
</div>

<p>They had no chairs, but sat upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
skins, or mats, spread upon the
ground, which also served them for
beds. Their clothes were principally
made of the skins of animals,
which in winter were sewed together
with the fur side turned inwards.</p>

<p>The Indians were very fond of
trinkets and ornaments, and often
decorated their heads with feathers,
while fine polished shells were suspended
from their ears.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>A PAWNEE BRAVE.</h2>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 175px;">
    <a name="p006-illus.jpg" id="p006-illus.jpg"></a>
    <img src="images/p006-illus.jpg" width="175" height="268" alt="A warrior" title="" />
    <p class="caption2">Pawnee Brave.</p>
</div>

<p>The following anecdote is
related of a Pawnee
brave, or warrior, (son
of Red <a name="Knife" id="Knife"></a>Knife).</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-one, the
heroic deeds of this brave had
acquired for him in his nation
the rank of the bravest of the braves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
The savage practice of torturing
and burning to death their prisoners
existed in this nation. An unfortunate
female of the Paduca nation,
taken in war, was destined to this
horrid death.</p>

<p>Just when the funeral pile was
to be kindled,
this young
warrior, having
unnoticed
prepared two
fleet horses,
with the necessary
provisions,
sprang
from his seat,
liberated the
victim, seized
her in his
arms, placed
her on one of the horses, mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
the other himself, and made the utmost
speed toward the nation and
friends of the captive! The multitude,
dumb and nerveless, made no
effort to rescue their victim from her
deliverer. They viewed it as the
immediate act of the Great Spirit,
submitted to it without a murmur,
and quietly retired to their village.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>INDIAN GRATITUDE.</h2>

<p>As an Indian was straying
through a village on the
Kennebec, he passed a
gentleman standing at his
store door, and begged a piece of
tobacco. The person stepped
back, and selected a generous
piece, for which he received a gruff
"tank you," and thought no more of
the affair. Three or four months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
afterwards, he was surprised at an
Indian's coming into the store
and presenting him with a beautiful
miniature birch canoe, painted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
furnished with paddles to correspond.
On asking the meaning of
it, he was told, "Indian no forget;
you give me tobacco; me make this
for you." This man's gratitude for
a trifling favor had led him to bestow
more labor on his present than
would have purchased him many
pounds of his favorite weed.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>INDIAN OBSERVATION.</h2>

<p>On his return home to his
hut one day, an Indian
discovered that his venison,
which had been hung
up to dry, had been stolen.
After going some distance, he
met some persons, of whom he
inquired if they had seen a <i>little</i>, <i>old</i>,
<i>white</i> man, with a short gun, and accompanied
by a small dog with a bob-tail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
They replied in the affirmative;
and upon the Indian's assuring
them that the man thus described
had stolen his venison, they desired
to be informed how he was able to
give such a minute description of a
person whom he had not seen. The
Indian answered thus:</p>

<p>"The thief I know is a <i>little</i> man,
by his having made a pile of stones
in order to reach the venison from
the height I hung it standing on the
ground; that he is an <i>old</i> man, I
know by his short steps, which I have
traced over the dead leaves in the
woods; that he is a <i>white</i> man, I
know by his turning out his toes
when he walks, which an Indian
never does; his gun I know to be
short by the mark which the muzzle
made by rubbing the bark of the
tree on which it leaned; that his dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
is small, I know by his tracks; and
that he has a bob-tail I discovered
by the mark of it in the dust where
he was sitting at the time his master
was taking down the meat."</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>INDIAN STRATAGEM.</h2>

<p>In one of the frequent
wars among
the different tribes
of Indians, a Pequot
was pursued
by a Naraganset
Indian. The Pequot
skulked behind
a rock, and
raising his hat on
his gun, held it
up just above the rock, so that the hat
alone was visible on the other side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>The Narraganset, who was at
some distance, perceiving the hat,
and supposing of course that the
head of the Pequot was in it, crept
softly up within a few feet and fired.
But directly he had the mortification
to find that he had thrown away his
powder. The Pequot's gun was still
loaded, and he discharged it to effect
upon the poor Narraganset.</p>

<h2>RED JACKET.</h2>

<p>It happened, during the
Revolutionary war, that a
treaty was held with the
Indians, at which Lafayette
was present. The object
was to unite the various tribes
in amity with America. The
majority of the chiefs were friendly,
but there was much opposition made
to it, more especially by a young
warrior, who declared that when an
alliance was entered into with America,
he should consider the sun of
his country as set forever. In his
travels through the Indian country,
when lately in America, it happened
at a large assemblage of chiefs that
Lafayette referred to the treaty in
question, and turning to Red Jacket,
said, "Pray, tell me, if you can, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
has become of that daring youth,
who so decidedly opposed all our
propositions for peace and amity?
Does he still live&mdash;and what is his
condition?" "I myself am the man,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
replied Red Jacket, "the decided
enemy of the Americans as long as
the hope of opposing them with success
remained, but now their true and
faithful ally until death."</p>

<h2>INDIAN SHREWDNESS.</h2>

<p>When General Lincoln
went to make peace
with the Creek Indians,
one of the chiefs asked
him to sit down on a log. He
was then desired to move, and
in a few minutes to move still
further. The request was repeated
until the general got to the end of the
log. The Indian still said, "Move further,"
to which the general replied,
"I can move no further." "Just so
it is with us," said the chief; "you
have moved us back to the water,
and then ask us to move further."</p>

<h2>AN INDIAN'S JOKE.</h2>

<p>During the time of Indian
troubles, a friendly Indian
visited Governor
Jenks, of Rhode Island,
when the governor took occasion
to request him to let him
know if any strange Indian
should come to his wigwam. This
the Indian promised to do, and the
governor agreed to give him a mug
of flip if he should give such information.
Some time after, the Indian
came again, and said, "Well, Mr.
Gubernor, strange Indian come to
my house last night." "Ah," said
the governor, "what did he say?"
"He no speak," replied the Indian.
"What, not speak at all?" inquired
the governor. "No, he no speak at
all." "That looks suspicious," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
his excellency, and inquired if he was
there still. Being told that he was,
the governor ordered the promised
mug of flip. When this was disposed
of, and the Indian was about to depart,
he mildly said, "Mr. Gubernor,
my squaw have child last night."
The governor, finding the strange
Indian was a new-born pappoose,
was glad to find there was no cause
for alarm.</p>

<h2>INDIAN CHARACTER.</h2>

<p>The following striking
display of Indian character
occurred some
years since in a town
in Maine. An Indian
of the Kennebec tribe,
remarkable for his good conduct,
received a grant of land from the
state, and fixed himself in a township,
where a number of families settled.
Though not ill treated, yet
the common prejudice against the
Indians prevented any sympathy
with him. This was shown at the
death of his only child, when none
of the people came near him. Shortly
afterwards he went to some of the
inhabitants, and said to them, "When
white man's child die, Indian man be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
sorry&mdash;he help bury him: when my
child die, no one speak to me&mdash;I
make his grave alone&mdash;I can't live
here."</p>

<p>He gave up his farm, dug up the
body of his child, and carried it with
him two hundred miles through the
forest, to join the Canada Indians.
What energy and depth of feeling
does this specimen of Indian character
exhibit!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>
<h2>INDIAN INTEGRITY.</h2>

<p>A Spanish traveller
met an Indian in
the desert; they
were both on
horseback. The
Spaniard, fearing
that his horse,
which was none
of the best, would
not hold out till
the end of his journey, asked the
Indian, whose horse was young,
strong, and spirited, to exchange
with him. This the Indian refused.
The Spaniard therefore began a
quarrel with him. From words
they proceeded to blows. The aggressor
being well armed, proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
too powerful for the native. He
seized his horse, mounted him, and
pursued his journey.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>He was closely followed
to the nearest
town by the Indian,
who immediately
complained
to a judge. The
Spaniard was obliged to appear, and
bring the horse with him. He treated
the Indian as an impostor, affirming
that the horse was his property,
that he had always had him in his
possession, and that he had raised
him from a colt.</p>

<p>There being no proof to the contrary,
the judge was about dismissing
the parties, when the Indian
cried out,&mdash;"The horse is mine,
and I'll prove it!" He immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
took off his mantle, and with it instantly
covered the head of the animal;
then addressing the judge,&mdash;"Since
this man," said he, "affirms
that he has raised the horse from a
colt, command him to tell of which
eye he is blind." The Spaniard, who
would not seem to hesitate, instantly
answered, "Of the right eye." "He
is neither blind of the right eye," replied
the Indian, "nor of the left."</p>

<p>The judge decreed him the horse,
and the Spaniard to be punished as
a robber.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>INDIAN POLITENESS.</h2>

<p>The politeness of these people
in conversation is indeed carried
to excess; since it does
not permit them to contradict or deny
the truth of what is asserted in
their presence. By this means they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
indeed avoid disputes; but then it
becomes difficult to know their
minds, or what impression you make
upon them. When any of them
come into our towns, our people are
apt to crowd around them, gaze upon
them, and incommode them when
they desire to be private; this they
esteem great rudeness, and the effect
of the want of instruction in the rules
of civility and good manners. "We
have," say they, "as much curiosity
as you, and when you come into our
towns, we wish for opportunities of
looking at you; but for this purpose
we hide ourselves behind bushes
where you are to pass, and never
intrude ourselves into your company."</p>
